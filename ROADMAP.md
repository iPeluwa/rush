# TaskRush Roadmap

## Current Version: v0.2.6

TaskRush has achieved its core mission as a modern task runner with parallel execution, intelligent caching, and smart dependency management. The foundation is solid, and now we're ready to build advanced features.

## v0.3.0 - Next Major Release (Plugin System & Advanced Features)

### 🔌 Plugin System for Extensibility

**Goal**: Allow users to extend TaskRush functionality through plugins

**Features**:
- Plugin API with Rust traits and WebAssembly support
- Plugin registry and discovery (`taskrush plugin install <name>`)
- Built-in plugin manager (`taskrush plugin list`, `taskrush plugin update`)
- Plugin configuration in `.rush` files
- Example plugins: git hooks, notifications, cloud integrations

**Implementation**:
```yaml
# Example plugin usage in .rush
plugins:
  - name: slack-notify
    config:
      webhook_url: ${SLACK_WEBHOOK}
      on_failure: true
  - name: git-hooks
    config:
      pre_commit: [lint, test]

tasks:
  deploy:
    cmd: kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
    plugins:
      - slack-notify: "🚀 Deployed to production"
```

### 📊 Task Profiling and Execution Metrics

**Goal**: Provide detailed insights into task performance and resource usage

**Features**:
- Execution time tracking with microsecond precision
- Memory and CPU usage monitoring
- Task dependency analysis and bottleneck identification
- Historical performance data and trends
- Export to formats (JSON, CSV, Prometheus metrics)
- Visual profiling reports (`taskrush profile --output=html`)

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Profiling commands
taskrush profile ci --duration=7d     # Show 7-day performance trends
taskrush profile --export=json        # Export metrics
taskrush analyze bottlenecks          # Find slow dependencies
```

### 🎯 Task Templates for Common Patterns

**Goal**: Quick project setup with industry-standard task configurations

**Features**:
- Built-in templates for popular frameworks
- Custom template creation and sharing
- Template registry and community templates
- Interactive template customization

**Templates**:
- **Node.js**: Build, test, lint, deploy for React/Vue/Angular
- **Rust**: Cargo build, test, clippy, docs, release
- **Python**: Poetry/pip, pytest, black, mypy, deploy
- **Docker**: Multi-stage builds, security scanning, registry push
- **Go**: Build, test, lint, release with goreleaser
- **Monorepo**: Workspace management, selective builds

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Template usage
taskrush init --template=node-react   # Create React project tasks
taskrush init --template=rust-cli     # Create Rust CLI project tasks
taskrush template create my-template  # Create custom template
taskrush template publish my-template # Share with community
```

### 🌐 Remote Task Execution

**Goal**: Execute tasks on different machines (CI servers, cloud instances, development machines)

**Features**:
- SSH-based remote execution
- Container-based isolation (Docker, Podman)
- Cloud provider integration (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Load balancing across multiple machines
- Secure credential management
- Remote dependency caching

**Implementation**:
```yaml
# Remote execution in .rush
remotes:
  ci-server:
    type: ssh
    host: ci.company.com
    user: taskrush
  
  build-cluster:
    type: kubernetes
    namespace: taskrush-builds

tasks:
  heavy-build:
    cmd: cargo build --release
    remote: build-cluster    # Run on Kubernetes
    
  integration-test:
    cmd: npm run test:integration
    remote: ci-server        # Run on CI server
```

### 💾 Advanced Caching Strategies

**Goal**: Intelligent, distributed caching for maximum efficiency

**Features**:
- **Cloud Cache**: Share cache across team members (S3, GCS, Azure Blob)
- **Content-Aware Caching**: Hash-based cache keys with dependency tracking
- **Distributed Cache**: P2P cache sharing between developers
- **Cache Analytics**: Hit/miss ratios, storage usage, performance impact
- **Smart Invalidation**: Automatic cache cleanup based on usage patterns

**Implementation**:
```yaml
# Advanced caching in .rush
cache:
  strategy: content-aware
  backends:
    - type: cloud
      provider: s3
      bucket: team-taskrush-cache
    - type: local
      path: ~/.taskrush/cache
  
  policies:
    max_size: 10GB
    ttl: 30d
    compression: true

tasks:
  build:
    cmd: npm run build
    cache:
      key_dependencies: [package.json, src/**/*.ts]
      outputs: [dist/]
      share_across_team: true
```

### 🔄 Task Retries and Failure Handling

**Goal**: Robust error handling with configurable retry strategies

**Features**:
- Configurable retry policies (exponential backoff, fixed delay, custom)
- Conditional retries based on exit codes or output patterns
- Failure notifications and alerts
- Partial failure recovery (continue with warnings)
- Failure analysis and recommendations

**Implementation**:
```yaml
tasks:
  flaky-integration-test:
    cmd: npm run test:integration
    retry:
      attempts: 3
      delay: exponential    # 1s, 2s, 4s
      on_codes: [1, 2]     # Only retry on specific exit codes
      on_pattern: "connection timeout"
    
  deploy:
    cmd: kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
    retry:
      attempts: 5
      delay: 10s
      notify_on_failure: slack-channel
```

### 📱 Interactive Mode for Task Selection

**Goal**: User-friendly task discovery and execution

**Features**:
- Interactive task browser with fuzzy search
- Task dependency visualization
- Real-time task status and progress
- Task history and favorites
- Keyboard shortcuts and vim-like navigation

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Interactive modes
taskrush                          # Launch interactive mode
taskrush --tui                    # Text-based UI
taskrush search "test"           # Fuzzy search tasks
taskrush history                 # Show recent task runs
taskrush favorites              # Show bookmarked tasks
```
